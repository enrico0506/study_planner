        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Study Planner is designed to work without an account. By default, your study data stays on your device and is stored
          locally in your browser. If you choose to create an account, you can enable cloud sync so the server stores a copy of your
          Study Planner state. This site may also display advertising (for example via Google AdSense), which can use cookies or similar
          technologies.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>Data stored on your device (default mode)</h2>
        <p>
          When you use the app without an account, Study Planner stores your subjects, tasks, notes, schedule entries, and settings in
          your browser (localStorage). This data is not automatically uploaded to the server. You can clear it at any time by removing
          site data in your browser settings. Some preferences (like theme and whether ads are shown) are also stored locally.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>Accounts and cloud sync (optional)</h2>
        <p>
          If you create an account, we process your email address and a password hash (your password itself is not stored in plain text).
          When cloud sync is enabled, the app uploads your Study Planner state to the server. The server stores the latest synced state and
          keeps a limited number of recent versions as backups to help you restore your data if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          To operate accounts securely, the service also uses short-lived verification and password-reset tokens. Authentication is handled
          via a secure, httpOnly cookie set by the server. If you do not want server-side storage, you can use the app without an account.
        </p>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>Advertising (Google AdSense)</h2>
        <p>
          This site may use Google AdSense to display ads. Google and its partners may use cookies and/or device identifiers to show ads,
          measure performance, and personalize content. You can learn more about Google’s advertising technologies and controls in Google’s
          privacy resources and your Google account settings.

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>Third-party resources</h2>
        <p>
          Some pages load third-party libraries from a content delivery network (CDN) to render math notation (KaTeX). When your browser
          requests these files, the CDN may receive standard connection data such as IP address, user agent, and timestamp. If you prefer to
          avoid third-party requests, you can self-host the libraries and serve them from your own domain.
        </p>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>Data retention</h2>
        <p>
          Local-only data remains on your device until you clear it. If you use an account, the server stores your account record and your
          synced Study Planner state until you delete the account or request deletion. Backup versions are retained in a limited rolling
          window to reduce storage while keeping recovery possible.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>Your choices</h2>
        <p>
          You can use Study Planner without an account, clear local storage at any time, and choose whether to sign in and sync. You can also
          disable ads in the app settings (stored locally on your device). Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access,
          correct, or delete personal data associated with your account. To make a request, use the contact page.
