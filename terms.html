        <h2>Using the app</h2>
        <p>
          Study Planner is provided to help you organize study work, track tasks, and plan sessions. You are responsible for the content you
          enter (for example, notes and task titles) and for making sure you have the rights to store and sync any material you upload. Do not
          use the service for unlawful, harmful, or abusive activity.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>Accounts</h2>
        <p>
          Creating an account is optional. If you create one, you must provide an email address you control and choose a strong password. You
          are responsible for keeping your login credentials confidential and for all activity under your account. If you believe your account
          has been compromised, contact us and change your password as soon as possible.
        </p>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>Availability and changes</h2>
        <p>
          We aim to keep Study Planner available and reliable, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted operation. The app may change over time,
          including features, limits, and user interface updates. We may suspend access to protect the service, comply with legal obligations,
          or respond to security incidents.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>Advertising</h2>
        <p>
          The site may display third-party advertising (for example via Google AdSense). Ads are controlled by third-party providers and may be
          personalized based on cookies or device signals. You can disable ads in app settings where available, and you can also manage ad
          personalization through provider controls.
        </p>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          Study Planner is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind, to the maximum extent permitted by law. We do not warrant that the
          app will meet your requirements, that it will be error-free, or that it will prevent data loss. You should keep backups of important
          data and verify critical deadlines independently.
        </p>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or
          for any loss of data, profits, or revenues, arising from your use of the service. In jurisdictions that do not allow certain
          limitations, these limitations apply to the fullest extent permitted.
